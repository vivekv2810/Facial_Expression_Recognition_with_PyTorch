# Facial_Expression_Recognition_with_PyTorch
This project aims to develop a facial expression recognition system using PyTorch. The system classifies facial expressions into various categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle and includes multiple facial expressions.
